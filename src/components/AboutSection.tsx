          <p>Hi, I'm Mark Proctor — a lifelong drummer and passionate teacher based in Claremore, Oklahoma. I picked up my first pair of sticks at age 9 and haven't stopped since.</p>
          <p>For over a decade, I've been helping students of all ages build skill, confidence, and a love for music. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to refine your technique, my lessons are personalized to your goals — and always rooted in patience, encouragement, and rhythm.</p>
          <p>I've played everything from rock and country to jazz, worship, and marching band. Over the years, I've had the privilege of performing with local groups, teaching in schools, and watching students grow into confident players both on and off the stage.</p>
          <p>My mission is simple: make learning drums fun, approachable, and rewarding — no matter your age or experience level.</p>
          <p><b>Let's find your groove together.</b></p>
